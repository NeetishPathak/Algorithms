Dear Professor,

I have some comments on problem 1

Problem 1: Line sweep

I have tried implementing the line sweep using both Map and set in c++
With both of them I could match your output for single intersection.

For extra credit:

But with multiple instersections, my answers are not macthing 

My set based implementation is the function sweepLineIntersectionAllPoints2 in my code
With this approach, there are some issues (duplicate values) and all the outputs are not getting printed. I am unable to figure out what is wrong.

My map implemntation is the function sweepLineIntersection in my code. It is giving me 57 /84 outputs on the file input_ec1.txt
(I have submitted this as my solution)

You may check above implementations in my code

So I implemented a naive algorithm to print all intersections, it prints all the outputs correctly. 84/84 
Naive implementation can be triggered by setting the macro (#define useNavie_nSq 0) in my code. It is 0 by default


I know the output is expected using line sweep and not naive but after all the attempts i made, still didnt suceed. There is some mistake I am not able to catch.

If you can consider this effort to some extent, it'll be great. Thanks

Thanks

Neetish
